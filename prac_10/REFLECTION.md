1. regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve
  during the course of the subject?

    > I wouldn't say my accuracy has improved. However, I did notice a pattern where I would finish a task either double or half the expected time, rarely in between. I still need to work on it.

2. regarding **code reviews**, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

    > Getting reviews helped me realise that no matter how long I stare at my code, there will be something to miss or can be improved. Doing the reviews allowed me to practice going through someone's code who has a different way of thinking than me, and it also gave me insight into how I can incorporate their solution to some of my future problem tasks.

3. regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

    > I would make prac_07 a little bit easier. The exam preparation week for study period two subjects coincides with the prac_07 task.
